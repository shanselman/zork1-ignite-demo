## Notes

This is a partial completion demonstrating successful gameplay. Full completion (350/350 points) requires collecting all 19 treasures and placing them in the trophy case in the living room, which typically takes 200+ moves.

The game was played successfully at the command line using the Fic interpreter, demonstrating that the historical Zork I source code can be compiled and played using modern tools.
